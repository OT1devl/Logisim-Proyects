# 🔌 Logisim Projects – ALUs, CPUs & More

This repository contains a collection of **Logisim** projects, all designed completely **from scratch**, without external guides. Each circuit reflects a deep understanding of digital logic and how real hardware systems are built.

## 📆 Included Projects

### 1. 8-Bit Arithmetic ALU
- 🧬 Functions: Addition and subtraction using two's complement.
- 🔧 Components: 8-bit adder, XOR gates, `Subtract` control input.
- 🎯 Status: **Fully functional**
- 🧠 Complexity: Intermediate (built without tutorials or templates).
- 💡 Upcoming: Logical operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT), overflow handling, and accumulator register.

## 🧠 Project Philosophy

These circuits weren’t just assembled—they were **mentally engineered from scratch**, understanding bitflow, control logic, and the core principles that power real-world CPUs.

My goal is not only to build logic hardware, but to share an **educational and creative approach** that helps anyone learn how computers work at the most fundamental level.

## 🚀 Requirements

- Logisim or Logisim Evolution (recommended)
- Curiosity to learn how a computer works from the ground up

---

## 🛠️ Future Ideas

- Full ALU with logical operations and MUX-based control
- Simple CPU with registers, RAM, and instruction decoding
- Turing machine simulation using pure logic gates
- Flag outputs: Carry, Zero, Overflow, Negative
- ROM integration to run small programs
